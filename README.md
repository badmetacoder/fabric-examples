Examples from my Fabric book.

    `color-output-functions.py` -- three simple functions for printing info, warning, and error messages in color.

    `color-rotate.py` -- a silly example of how you can turn any text string into a rainbow explosion.

    `server-inventory.py` -- a handy set of functions for doing server setup investigations. Helps answer that burning question, 'What the hell is that machine running?'
